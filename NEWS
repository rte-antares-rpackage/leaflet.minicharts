Changes in version 0.3.1 (2017-05-30)

BUGFIXES:
* addMinicharts() uses functions that are only available in package leaflet >= 1.1.0. The package now requires this version of leaflet.


Changes in version 0.3 (2017-05-19)

NEW FEATURES:
* Default popups are now automatically generated for charts and flows. A new function "popupArgs()" has been added to control how popups are generated.
* The size of the JSON data passed from R to javascript has been optimized. In some situations it has been divided by 10, so maps are generated quicker and when they are saved on harddrive, the resulting files are smaller.

BUGFIXES:
* The default color palette was not found when leaflet.minicharts was imported in another package.
* add/updateMinicharts/Flows were crashing if layerId was a factor and some levels were missing.
* Some bugs were occuring if after an update of a map, the number of timesteps increased.


Changes in version 0.2 (2017-05-05)

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Argument "data" of addMinicharts() and updateMinicharts() has been renamed "chartdata" to avoid confusion with parameter "data" of function leaflet().

NEW FEATURES:
* addMinicharts() now automatically adds a legend to the map by default.
* addMinicharts() has new parameters "labelMinSize" and "labelMaxSize" to control label size.
* addMinicharts() has a new parameter "time" that can be used to create an animated map that represents the evolution of one or more variables. Animations can be shared by saving the map as html or including it in a Ramrkdown document. No need to use Shiny anymore!
* New functions removeMinicharts() and clearMinicharts() to remove some or all minicharts from a map.
* It is now possible to represent flows between two points with function addFlow() and the associated functions updateFlows(), removeFlows() and clearFlows().

BUGFIXES:
* addMinicharts was crashing if user tried to add a single chart to a map.
